# WPDisclosure Mass Target

Wordpress Information Disclosure Mass target, Get username from anylink wordpress site
Wordpress is the most popular CMS of the century, but over time there have been tons of plugins and themes which are very supportive of new things. But the old gaps don't seem to have been patched by wordpress like many are found in the xmlrpc section. WPDiclosure scan is used to find the username of all wordpress links that you use, this is a small bug that is often combined for brute force attacks.

How use?

$ bash wpdisc.sh

any taget on file.txt / example file.txt : http://taget1.com

Do not use this tool illegally, I am not responsible for any damage.

Thanks
